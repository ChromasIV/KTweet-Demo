# KTweet-Demo
A Demo of using KTweet within an application.

## Application Details

This example uses Ktor to host a backend API that helps authenticate you with X (focus on OAuth2.0 and obtaining a user's access/refresh token).

In order to use this application, you will need to obtain a developer account from X / Twitter and obtain the client ID/secret from their developer page. [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api)


## Setup

You must ensure the following VM options are set.
1. clientId
2. clientSecret

Run the application and go to 127.0.0.1:8080 to log in using X (Twitter)

## TO-DO:

I am only able to test the Free API version, if you wish to support the development, visit [KTweet](https://github.com/ChromasIV/KTweet) and check out the [Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/ChromasIV) option!
